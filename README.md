# christmas-scripts
A christmas version of those popular ascii-scripts. 
Note: I don't know who the orginal creator of those scripts is, I just turned it into a christmas version.
If you do, please let me know so that I can give proper credit.

## General info
The bash-scripts display a color scheme in your terminal: one with christmas trees, one with snowflakes and one with Santa a reindeers 
(well, kind of Santa at least...)
